## Snake 

Control a snake that moves around the screen. Your goal is to eat the food items that appear, which makes your snake longer. Be careful not to run into the walls or yourself, as that will end the game. The longer you survive and the more food you eat, the higher your score will be.

## Pong Game

Pong is a classic two-player arcade game where you control paddles on either side of the screen. Your objective is to bounce the ball back and forth, preventing it from passing your side. As the game progresses, the ball's speed increases, adding to the challenge. Score points by making the ball pass your opponent's paddle.

## U.S. State Guesser

The U.S. State Guesser game tests your knowledge of U.S. states. You're presented with a blank map of the United States, and you need to guess the names of the states. Type the names of the states you recognize, and the game will mark your correct guesses on the map. Try to guess all 50 states! If you don't score 50/50, the program will create a csv file listing all of the states that you missed.

## Cross the Road

In Cross the Road, you control a turtle attempting to cross a busy road. Dodge passing cars and reach the other side safely. The game gets more challenging as cars move faster and more frequently. Aim to cross as many times as you can while avoiding collisions.

## Blackjack 

Blackjack is a popular card game where you compete against the computer dealer. The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. You're dealt two cards initially and can choose to "hit" for additional cards. Be strategic in your decisions to beat the dealer and win the game.
